# Superpowers Lab

Experimental skills for [Claude Code Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) - new techniques and tools under active development.

## What is this?

This plugin contains experimental skills that extend Claude Code's capabilities with new techniques that are still being refined and tested. These skills are functional but may evolve based on real-world usage and feedback.

## Current Skills

### finding-duplicate-functions

Detect semantic code duplication in LLM-generated codebases. Unlike traditional copy-paste detectors that find syntactic duplicates, this skill identifies functions with the same intent but different implementations.

**Use cases:**
- Audit codebases that have grown organically with multiple contributors
- Identify utility functions that have been reimplemented multiple times
- Find consolidation opportunities before major refactoring
- Complement jscpd after syntactic duplicates are handled

**How it works:** Two-phase approach using classical function extraction followed by LLM-powered intent clustering. Haiku categorizes functions by domain, then Opus analyzes each category to find semantic duplicates.

See [skills/finding-duplicate-functions/SKILL.md](skills/finding-duplicate-functions/SKILL.md) for full documentation.

### mcp-cli

Use MCP servers on-demand via the `mcp` CLI tool. Discover and invoke tools, resources, and prompts without polluting context with pre-loaded MCP integrations.

**Use cases:**
- Query MCP servers without permanent configuration
- Explore available tools before deciding to integrate
- One-off MCP tool invocations

See [skills/mcp-cli/SKILL.md](skills/mcp-cli/SKILL.md) for full documentation.

### using-tmux-for-interactive-commands

Enables Claude Code to control interactive CLI tools (vim, git rebase -i, menuconfig, REPLs, etc.) through tmux sessions.

**Use cases:**
- Interactive text editors (vim, nano)
- Terminal UI tools (menuconfig, htop)
- Interactive REPLs (Python, Node, etc.)
- Interactive git operations (rebase -i, add -p)
- Any tool requiring keyboard navigation and real-time interaction

**How it works:** Creates detached tmux sessions, sends keystrokes programmatically, and captures terminal output to enable automation of traditionally manual workflows.

See [skills/using-tmux-for-interactive-commands/SKILL.md](skills/using-tmux-for-interactive-commands/SKILL.md) for full documentation.
